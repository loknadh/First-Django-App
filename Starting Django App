What is a Django App?
A Django app is a modular component of a Django project. It typically handles a single feature or section of a website — like blog, login, or products. 
You can have multiple apps in a single Django project.

How to Create Your First App in Django

1. Activate your virtual environment
 django_env\Scripts\activate
2. Make Sure You’re in the Project Directory
 cd mysite
3. Create a New App
 python manage.py startapp blog
4. Add the App to settings.py
 Open mysite/settings.py and add 'blog', to the INSTALLED_APPS list:
 INSTALLED_APPS = [
         ...
         'blog',
  ]
5. Create a View Function // my local PC : C:\Users\lokna\mysite\blog\migrations
 In blog/views.py, add the following:
 
 from django.http import HttpResponse
 def home(request):
  return HttpResponse("Hello, Django Blog!")
6. Create a URLconf for the App in the folder :- C:\Users\lokna\mysite\blog
 Create a file named urls.py inside the blog folder and add:
 from django.urls import path
 from . import views

 urlpatterns = [
  path('', views.home, name='blog-home'),
 ]
7. Include App URLs in the Project’s urls.py
 Open mysite/urls.py and update it like this:
 from django.contrib import admin
 from django.urls import path, include

 urlpatterns = [
  path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  path('', include('blog.urls')),
 ]

8. Run the Development Server
 python manage.py runserver
9. Open Your Browser and Test
 Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
